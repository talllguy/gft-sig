# GFT Email Signature Template

This repository contains the standardized email signature format for GFT staff.

## ✉️ How to Use

1. Open [`signature.html`](./signature.html) in your browser.
2. Copy the **rendered signature** (not the HTML code).
3. Paste it into your email signature settings in **Outlook** or **OWA**.
4. Update your personal details (name, title, contact info) as needed.

> 💡 For best results in OWA, right-click and choose **“Keep Source Formatting”** when pasting.
